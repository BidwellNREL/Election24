# Election Slate 2022

## Chair

### John Blaas

I would like to be considered for Chair of the SIGHPC SYSPROS ACM Chapter. I have been assisting with the planning and delivery of SIGHPC SYSPROS workshops at SC and PEARC for the past few years in various roles, and have served in the past as a member-at-large. I also serve on the steering committee for the CaRCC systems facing track, helping in the planning and hosting of the monthly calls. I currently work at the National Center for Atmospheric Research as a HPC Systems Engineer, and have worked in similar roles for over 10 years.

As Chair of the chapter, I want to increase attendance at our workshops and encourage growth through folks joining and participating in ad hoc discussions on our Slack channels. I want to bring a greater emphasis on collaborating more closely with other communities that are adjacent to our own and I want to provide more visibility to student projects and training in order to better meet the talent shortage that we often see in our growing field.

I look forward to continuing to contribute to SIGHPC SYSPROS and I appreciate your consideration for this position.

## Vice Chair

### David Clifton

Hello SysPros, I'm David Clifton, Lead Systems Engineer for internal on-prem HPC at Ansys, a leading developer of CAE simulation software.  It has been my pleasure to serve as the Vice President of the ACM SIGHPC Systems Professionals virtual chapter for the last four years, and I would appreciate your support for a third and final term. The chapter has evolved well over the last several years, and together we have built a great community for HPC admins of all skill levels. We have refined the processes for setting up the SysPros workshops at SC and PEARC to a very repeatable level, and we hope to get one going at ISC in the near future. With your support, we can continue to expand our community to new regions and institutions.

## Membership Chair

### Stephen Fralich

Ever since I learned of supercomputing systems while in high school, I was fascinated by both the technical aspects of them as well as the research that they enable. I’ve been working with Linux HPC systems since the early 2000s and with UNIX/Linux systems since I was in high school. I’m currently an HPC Systems Architect at Boeing. Prior to Boeing, I worked in higher education for almost 20 years. I served as the committee Secretary for the past two years and as a Member-at-Large prior to that. I have also served on SC workshop organizing and submission review committees. I'm looking forward to the challenge of building the chapter's membership base over the next two years.

I have experience designing, procuring and operating HPC systems for a variety of workloads in the life sciences.

My service on NHLBI and NIH committees has given me experience in bridging the gap between the needs of researchers and design and operation of HPC systems to meet those needs. Through my role supporting users, I’ve seen the gaps in HPC training and demand for technical expertise and I welcome the opportunity to serve the chapter
and the community.   I've been a  volunteer with the SCinet NetSec
