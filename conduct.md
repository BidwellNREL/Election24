# SIGHPC SYSPROS Code of Conduct

SIGHPC SYSPROS (SYSPROS) community is dedicated to providing a welcoming and supportive environment for all participants in activities enabled in some way by SYSPROS, and when individuals represent SYSPROS at any other function. The Code of Conduct sets forth guidelines for participant behavior that will help the community to achieve welcoming and inclusive spaces for engagement, and outlines examples of behavior that may otherwise negatively impact these shared goals. Resolution procedures are structured to encourage participants to report examples of behavior that may adversely impact inclusive participation in SYSPROS, regardless of intent, so that the community may discuss and productively reflect on them to improve future engagement. By participating in the SYSPROS community, participants accept the shared priority of abiding by the SYSPROS Code of Conduct and accept the procedures by which any Code of Conduct incidents are resolved.
Applicability
This Code of Conduct applies to all spaces managed, hosted, or sponsored by the SYSPROS community, including, but not limited to, meetings, email lists, and online forums such as Slack, where conversations may pertain to or otherwise represent the SYSPROS community and its activities. By participating, participants indicate their acceptance of the procedures by which SYSPROS resolves any Code of Conduct incidents.

## Anticipated Behavior
In order to foster a positive and professional community environment, the community encourages the following kinds of behaviors in all platforms and events:

* Be respectful of different viewpoints and experiences
* Focus on what is best for the community
* Show courtesy and respect towards other community members
* Use welcoming and inclusive language
* Advertisement of products or services is prohibited

## Inclusivity
Participants in SYSPROS events and activities should do their best to foster fair participation of all people, including those of underrepresented groups. Prejudicial discrimination on the basis of age, color, disability, ethnicity, family status, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, political affiliation, labor union membership, military status, nationality, race, religion, or any other identity is an explicit violation of the SYSPROS Code of Conduct. Harassment and discrimination, including sexual harassment, bullying, and other abuses of power and authority, among other harms, limit fair access to the virtual and physical spaces where such harassment takes place.

While the use of information and technology has increased access and inclusivity in many cases, the use of information and technology, they may also cause new, or enhance existing, inequities. Technologies and practices should be as inclusive and accessible as possible and research CI professionals should take action to avoid creating or leveraging technologies that disenfranchise or oppress people.

## Privacy and Confidentiality
Participants in SYSPROS events and activities may be explicitly or implicitly entrusted with confidential information shared by other participants, such as trade secrets, client data, non-public business strategies, financial information, research data, pre-publication scholarly articles, and funding applications. Participants should protect confidentiality except in cases where there is evidence of the violation of law, of organizational regulations, or of the Code of Conduct. In these cases, the nature or contents of that information should not be disclosed except to appropriate authorities.

## Behavior that violates the code
Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants at any SYSPROS event/platform include:
* written or verbal comments which have the effect of excluding people on the basis of membership of any specific group
* causing someone to fear for their safety, such as through stalking, following, or intimidation
* violent threats or language directed against another person
* the display of sexual or violent images
* unwelcome sexual attention
* nonconsensual or unwelcome physical contact
* sustained disruption of talks, events or communications
* insults or put downs
* sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist, or exclusionary jokes or comments
* Open solicitation of products
* excessive swearing
* incitement to violence, suicide, or self-harm
* continuing to initiate interaction (including photography or recording) with someone after being asked to stop
* sharing of private communication without consent

## Reporting troublesome behavior 
If you believe someone has violated the Code of Conduct, please report it to SYSPROS Leadership by emailing contact@sighpc-syspros.org. All reports will be reviewed by relevant members of SYSPROS Leadership and the identities of those involved will be kept confidential to the extent possible. (If one of the Leadership members were identified as violating the Code of Conduct, then review would exclude that individual.)

## Consequences of unacceptable conduct
Participants who are asked to stop any violating behavior by another community member or organizer are expected to comply immediately. This applies to any SYSPROS events and platforms, either online or in-person. With or without immediate intervention by another community member, the organizers and/or community members may ask the offender to leave the event, and/or engage the SYSPROS Leadership to investigate the Code of Conduct violation and seek appropriate resolution with the offender. Similarly, any content or recording including violating behavior may be removed and/or edited, if shared/hosted via SYSPROS infrastructure, to prevent further harm. In some cases, the reviewing individuals may determine that a public statement of the handling of the incident is necessary. If that is the case, the identities of all involved parties and reporters will remain confidential.
