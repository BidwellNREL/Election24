### John Legato

My name is John Legato and I'd like to be considered for the position Member-At-Large for SIGHPC-SYSPROS. I've been working as an  HPC System Administrator in the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute(NHLBI) at the National Institutes of Health since 2003. I have experiencedesigning, procuring and operating HPC systems for a variety of workloads in the life sciences.

My service on NHLBI and NIH committees has given me experience in bridging the gap between the needs of researchers and design and operation of HPC systems to meet those needs. Through my role supporting users, I've seen the gaps in HPC training and demand for technical expertise and I welcome the opportunity to serve the chapter and the community,
