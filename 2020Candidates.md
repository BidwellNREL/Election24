### Stephen Fralich

Ever since I learned of supercomputing systems while in high school, I was fascinated by both the technical aspects of them as well as the research that they enable. I’ve been working with Linux HPC systems since the early 2000s and with UNIX/Linux systems since I was in high school. I’m currently an HPC Systems Engineer at Boeing. Prior to Boeing, I lead the technical side of University of Washington’s central HPC effort for almost ten years and worked as an HPC Systems Administrator at the University of Chicago. I served as Member at Large for the first two years of the chapter’s life. I also served on the SC19 workshop organizing and submission review committees.

### John Legato

My name is John Legato and I'd like to be considered for the position Member-At-Large for SIGHPC-SYSPROS. I've been working as an  HPC System Administrator in the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute(NHLBI) at the National Institutes of Health since 2003. I have experiencedesigning, procuring and operating HPC systems for a variety of workloads in the life sciences.

My service on NHLBI and NIH committees has given me experience in bridging the gap between the needs of researchers and design and operation of HPC systems to meet those needs. Through my role supporting users, I've seen the gaps in HPC training and demand for technical expertise and I welcome the opportunity to serve the chapter and the community.
