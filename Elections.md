## Background

The ACM SIGHPC SYSPROS chapter is a platform for discussing the unique challenges that come from supporting large-scale, high performance systems. We speak directly to the state of the practice of standing up and operating high performance systems with an emphasis on solutions that can be implemented by systems staff at other institutions.

The current leadership team is listed here:
http://sighpc-syspros.org/SIGHPCSystemsOfficers.html

The leadership team's current focuses are on semi-annual workshops (at PEARC and SC currently) and on a collaboration with SIGHPC Education to formalize HPC Systems Professionals training and education.

The proceedings of past workshops and symposiums can be found here:
